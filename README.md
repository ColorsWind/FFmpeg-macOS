# FFmpeg-macOS
FFmpeg shared universal binaries (x86_64 and arm64) for macOS.

## Usage

You may compile it by yourself or download and install prebuild binary.

- **Compile FFmpeg by yourself.**

    By default, our script will compile FFmpeg with `--enable-shared --disable-static`, if you want to use custom flags, you can edit `make_compile.py`.
    
    Available options: `--ffmpeg_dir --target_dir --dir`, use `-h` to see help.
    
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:embodyme/FFmpeg-macOS.git build-script
    git clone git@github.com:FFmpeg/FFmpeg.git ffmpeg
    cd ffmpeg
    git checkout n4.1
    python ../build-script/make_compile.py 
    python ../build-script/make_universal.py
    python ../build-script/package.py --tag n4.1
    ```

- **Install Prebuilt Binary**

  You may download from [release](https://github.com/ColorsWind/FFmpeg-macOS/releases/) and install it by `install.py`.

  ```bash
  wget https://github.com/ColorsWind/FFmpeg-macOS/releases/download/n5.0.1-patch3/FFmpeg-shared-n5.0.1-OSX-universal.zip
  wget https://github.com/ColorsWind/FFmpeg-macOS/releases/download/n5.0.1-patch3/install.py
  python install.py FFmpeg-shared-n5.0.1-OSX-universal.zip ~/ffmpeg-n5.0.1
  ```
  Then, FFmpeg-shared will be installed on `~/ffmpeg-n5.0.1`.
